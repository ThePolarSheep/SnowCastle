## Whoami

Terve!

I call my self a Cybersecurity Enthusiast, but you can call me The Sheep or The Polar Sheep. I am  studying cybersecurity in a Finnish University of Applied Sciences. At the same time I work as a cybersecurity enthusiast in a cybersecurity company where I get to do all kind of fun things related to hacking. At some point I might share something from my work also, taking in consideration my NDA. But for now I'll keep posting about my completed challenges related to cybersecurity.

### More Information

At times when I'm not studying, working or having fun hacking, you can propably find me gaming. Heres my handles:
* Xbox / Battle.net: HydroGel
* PC: thepolarsheep
